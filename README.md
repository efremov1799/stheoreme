Description: Functions implementing the procedure of entropy comparison between two data samples after the renormalization of respective probability distributions with the algorithm designed by Klimontovich ([Zeitschrift fur Physik B Condensed Matter. 1987, Volume 66, Issue 1, pp 125-127](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01312769)) and extended by Anishchenko ([Proc. SPIE 2098, Computer Simulation in Nonlinear Optics. 1994, pp.130-136](https://spie.org/Publications/Proceedings/Paper/10.1117/12.175137)).  The package also includes data preparation tools which can also be used separately for various applications.
